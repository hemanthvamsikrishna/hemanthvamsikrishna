## About

I build AI systems from first principles. My work spans deep learning architectures, natural language processing, and computer vision—implemented not just using frameworks, but understanding the mathematics and algorithms that power them.

Currently focused on bringing AI to healthcare (ECG analysis), air traffic control (reinforcement learning), and making data visualization accessible through natural language.

Previously founded two startups: an AgTech venture in AI-driven hydroponics and a collaborative manufacturing AI platform for distributed quality control.

## Featured Work

### Deep Learning from Scratch

**[RNN and Transformer](https://github.com/hemanthvamsikrishna/rnn-transformer-from-scratch)**  
Complete implementation of sequence models: VanillaRNN, LSTM, GRU, and multi-head self-attention. Includes text generation on Shakespeare and sentiment analysis. Built the same attention mechanisms that power GPT and BERT.

**[CNN Architectures](https://github.com/hemanthvamsikrishna/cnn-architecture-from-scratch)**  
LeNet-5 and MiniVGG implementations with im2col optimization for efficient convolution. Trained on CIFAR-10 for image classification. Demonstrates computer vision fundamentals without using PyTorch or TensorFlow.

**[Neural Networks](https://github.com/hemanthvamsikrishna/neural-network-from-scratch)**  
Foundational neural network with manual backpropagation and gradient verification. Includes dense layers, activation functions, and SGD optimizer. MNIST digit classification from pure NumPy.

### Applied AI Research

**Healthcare AI**  
Robust ECG R-peak detection and imbalanced arrhythmia classification using TabNet and advanced ML techniques. Focus on clinical-grade accuracy for real-world deployment.

**Charter** *(In Progress)*  
Open-source application enabling natural-language-driven data visualization. Users describe what they want to see; AI generates the appropriate charts and dashboards.

**Air Traffic Control AI**  
Reinforcement learning system for runway conflict detection and resolution. Safety-critical AI with real-time decision making in simulated environments.

**Hive Quality Network**  
Multi-company platform for collaborative defect detection in manufacturing. Distributed AI system enabling companies to share pattern recognition insights while maintaining data privacy.

## Philosophy

I believe in building AI systems that challenge industries, not just optimize them. Every project starts from first principles—understanding the mathematics, implementing the algorithms, and only then scaling with frameworks.

Research should solve real problems. Code should be elegant. Systems should be robust. And AI should empower people, not just automate tasks.

Beyond code and research, I'm committed to physical resilience through body recomposition training—discipline in one area strengthens discipline in all areas.
