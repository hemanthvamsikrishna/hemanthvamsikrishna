## About

I build end-to-end AI systems—transformer architectures, RAG pipelines, production NLP, and computer vision models. My work spans deep learning research and production deployment.

Currently: Healthcare AI (ECG analysis), reinforcement learning for air traffic control, and natural language-driven data visualization.

Previously founded two startups in AgTech and mobility innovation.
